This file documents some more visible changes, in particular if they
change previous behavior.

* Version 4.13
- The default value of
  `cdlatex-cdlatex-make-sub-superscript-roman-if-pressed-twice' is now
  t, meaning the feature is turned on by default.
- We used to use _{\rm ...} to create roman subscripts.  This is not
  longer up to standards with LaTeX, so we have now switched to using
  \mathrm instead.  Thanks to Sinthoras for pointing this out.  
- The selection characters for the \overbrace construct has changes.
  It used to be '{ and it is now '] .  The changes was needed to free
  up the { character for the next point.
- It is now easier to inject a \left( ... \right) construct after the
  content has already been typed.  Just select the content and type '(
  Similarly, you can inject left-right pairs or {, [, <, and | in the
  same way.  Thanks to Sinthoras for this proposal.
