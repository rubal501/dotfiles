  [033m! Emacs was not built with native compilation support[0m
    Users will see a substantial performance gain by building Emacs with
    native compilation support, availible in emacs 28+.You must install a
    prebuilt Emacs binary with this included, or compile Emacs with the
    --with-native-compilation option.

[033m! Detected Fish as your $SHELL[0m
  Fish (and possibly other non-POSIX shells) is known to inject garbage
  output into some of the child processes that Emacs spawns. Many Emacs
  packages/utilities will choke on this output, causing unpredictable
  issues. To get around this, either:
  
    - Add the following to $DOOMDIR/config.el:
  
      (setq shell-file-name (executable-find "bash"))
  
    - Or change your default shell to a POSIX shell (like bash or zsh)
      and explicitly configure your terminal apps to use the shell you
      want.
  
  If you opt for option 1 and use one of Emacs' terminal emulators, you
  will also need to configure them to use Fish, e.g.
  
    (setq-default vterm-shell (executable-find "fish"))
  
    (setq-default explicit-shell-file-name (executable-find "fish"))
